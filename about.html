        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student focused on continuous self-improvement in software development. Throughout my university education, I've gained experience in basic programming, algorithms, and object-oriented programming using C, C++, and C#. I'm also continuing to improve my skills, particularly in Python and JavaScript. I've also been active in numerous student clubs throughout my university years. These experiences have taught me the skills of organization, responsibility, and effective communication with diverse audiences. I'm a team player, with strong communication skills and a strong sense of responsibility.</p>
